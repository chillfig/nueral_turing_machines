Suppose we have an input batch of 16 episodes of image samples, with each episode being of equal length of 50. Based on the design of the rest of the project (which we have already implemented for you), MANNCell should be called 50 times, each time having 16 input samples (along with the offseted labels), and outputting 16 output labels. More specifically, the MANNCell should produce classification labels $[\\hat{y}_0^t, ..., \\hat{y}_{15}^t]$ for all 16 iteration-$t$ image samples batch $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y_0^t, ..., x^t_{15}+y_{14}^t]$ (\"+\" means concatenation) every time it is called; for your information, it is the class NTMOneShotLearningModel (already implemented below) that actually calls MANNCell 50 times. Your job is to make sure that at a single iteration $t$ (where $t=0,1,2,...,49$), MANNCell correctly parses the input arguments, produce the correct read and write weights $w^r_t, w^w_t$, correctly retrieve from and write to the memory to form $M_t$, and use the right material to get the logits for classification (they will be used for computing the labels and cross-entropy values in NTMOneShotLearningModel), and return the right states that will be used in the next iteration $t+1$. \n",

        "> [a]:Discuss differences between read, write and addressing implementations of NTM and MANN given in following two papers.\n",

        "\n",
        "> ANS: With respect to the NTM and MANN papers provided, there were indeed a few differences made in adapting MANN from NTM. Firstly, with respect to the operation of reading memory, the equations used for read vectors remained the same in adapting from NTM to MANN, however the read-write vector appeared to change (in MANN) by firstly using an exponential average according to softmax, and using an output layer according to softmax to be input to future states.\n",
        "\n",
        "With respect to the operation of writing, one of the main differences to come out of this is that the NTM paper tended to use an operaton with erase and add vectors, using each of these in their memory operations. In MANN, however, an addition is made with respect to the addressing operation, which forces the write function to adapt accordingly. Because of this, the MANN paper uses a different vector ki in its writing operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, with respect to the addressing operation, the NTM paper uses two methods concurrently, one being addressing by content, and the other being by memory. The main idea with these methods was that if the content addressing failed (i.e. similar content has already been stored) then the addressing by memory will serve as a backup. MANN, however learns to solve this issue by implementing Least Recently Used Access (LRUA) which is content based memory addressing only. With LRUA, addressing is interpolated between past read weights and weights scaled by usage weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> [b]:In general, is NTM one of the ways to implement MANN?\n",
        "\n",
        "> ANS: In addressing the question of whether or not NTM can provide one of the ways to implement a MANN, I would say no. With respect to the read and write operations, the NTM and MANN papers are fairly similar. The real major difference between the two papers comes with the addressing operation which, though identical in the beginning, the papers diverge with memory operations that appear to operate fairly differently given a longer runtime (with a large amount of memory usage)."

        "4. Report the best ACC(1st instance), ..., ACC(10th instance) that your NTM model can reach.You should be able to outperform the simple LSTM network from part 1 by a large marginin around 10,000 epochs of training, but feel free to train it for less epochs.Remark: In the first few thousand of epochs, the model’s loss could stay very high with littlechange. Please have patience, if your implementation is correct, it should most likely startdecreasing before you reach 10,000 epochs of training. Please note that it could happenthat your implementation is correct but the loss just does not change (training this networkrequires a bit of luck!); we suggest restarting the training (so with a different random ini-tialization of the weights) if you do not see the loss changing for 5,000 to 7,000 epochs; youmight need to check your code though if a number of restarts still do not help.\n",
        "\n",
        "[ANS]: For part 1, at 10k, the accuracy was 50%, 20k accuracy was 80% and 30k the accuracy was 90% for the 10th instances. I noted a 90% accuracy on part 2 at epoch 59,200 which I found interesting. The program was exercised with a  longer epoch analysis of the MANN, however, it took so long that the program would delete, google colab would crash, and restart would be inevitable. So as recommended I stuck with fewer epochs on the submission.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Having gone through the exercise, in your opinion, does every step in our implementationmake sense? For instance, do you think if we should have used more complicated struc-tures for computing the read keys, write keys and the interpolation coefficients? Maybewe should have written to the memory before reading from it? Maybe a better measure ofsimilarity than the cosine similarity in computing the reading weights? Does zeroing outthe least used memory slot from before really make sense? A better mechanism of writingto memory than the “least recently used access”? Is there any hope of utilizing the experi-ence and intuition we gained about NTMs and the one-shot learning task here on normalclassification problems? Please elaborate.\n",

        "[ANS]: The suggestion of writing to memory before reading would be very memory intensive, and may force an unnecessary dependency on prior episodes (especially those so far in the past that they may be irrelevant).\n",
        "The suggestion of a better measure of similarity (than cosine) for reading weights may not be necessary. Given this problem, the cosine similarity metric does seem to be a simple metric between points, and doesn't seem to be a poor similarity metric.\n",
        "The suggestion of zeroing out the least used memory slot could make sense, generally speaking. In scenarios where the least used memory slot is far less than the average memory slot usage, this could improve generalization performance, however in cases where the least used memory slot is somewhat close to the average memory slot usage, this could lead to important information being lost (almost like a catastrophic forgetting scenario).\n",
        "The suggestion of a better mechanism of writing to memory than LRUA could theoretically exist, but given the improvement from the original combination of content and memory addressing, this may not be a necessary step in terms of improving performance.\n",
        "The suggestion of utulizing NTMs and one-shot learning on normal classification problems is a potentially good one. Though (of course) the implementation of these are a bit complex, the usage of NTMs would be fairly successful in larger-scaled classification problems. In much smaller scenarios, however, it may be somewhat unnecessary especially when considering memory usage.\n",
